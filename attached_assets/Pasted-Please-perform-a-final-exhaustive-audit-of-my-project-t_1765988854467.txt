Please perform a final, exhaustive audit of my project to ensure it is fully portable and does not rely on any Replit-only features, including subtle or indirect ones.

⚠️ Important constraints:

Do NOT refactor, rewrite, or change working code.

This is an audit, verification, and documentation task only.

If you find Replit-specific behavior, report it clearly instead of modifying code.

1. Portability Audit (Final Pass)

Check for anything that may have been missed previously, including but not limited to:

Hidden or indirect Replit runtime APIs

Replit-injected environment variables or defaults

Replit filesystem or persistence assumptions

Preview, hosting, port binding, or networking behavior specific to Replit

Build, dev, or start scripts that behave differently outside Replit

UI, assets, or metadata implicitly relying on Replit

Auth, secrets, or config behavior that differs outside Replit

Any behavior that would fail when:

Pushed to GitHub

Downloaded as a ZIP

Edited in another editor or AI editor (e.g. Trae)

Deployed on a standard Node.js environment or VPS

For each issue found, provide:

File and location (if applicable)

Why it is Replit-specific

Whether it breaks portability

What the portable alternative should be (do not apply changes)

2. Replit Terminology & Behavior Dictionary (For AI Agents)

Create a clear reference / dictionary section explaining:

Replit-specific names, processes, environment variables, files, or behaviors

What each one does in plain language

The standard, non-Replit equivalent (or confirmation that it was removed)

This section must be written so other AI agents or editors can understand and work with the project without Replit context.

3. Environment Variables & .env Setup Instructions

Create a dedicated .env setup guide that includes:

A list of all required environment variables

For each variable:

Variable name

What it is used for

Which feature/module depends on it

Clear instruction such as:

“Ask the project architect or human editor to provide this value”

Example format:

DATABASE_URL — PostgreSQL connection string (used by X module)

SESSION_SECRET — Session encryption key (used by auth middleware)

R2_ACCESS_KEY — Cloud storage credentials (used by upload service)

4. Run, Build, and Deploy Instructions

Create a clear runbook that explains:

Required software (e.g. Node.js version, package manager)

How to install dependencies

How to build the project

How to run the project in development

How to run it in production

Example:

“Install Node.js vXX”

“Run npm install”

“Run npm run build”

“Run npm start”

Write this so a human or AI editor can run the app without guessing.

5. Final Verification Statement

End with a clear conclusion stating one and only one of the following:

✅ “This project is fully portable and safe to export, edit, and deploy outside Replit.”
OR

⚠️ “The following items must be addressed before full portability is guaranteed” (with a checklist)

Goal:
100% confidence that this project can be:

Pushed to GitHub

Downloaded as a ZIP

Edited in any IDE or AI editor

Deployed without Replit

Understood by other AI agents with no Replit context

Do not modify code. Audit, document, and verify only."
