Yes, I confirm and understand your approach.
Please proceed using the existing story and image architecture you already built.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION
Any text examples shown below (dates, photographer names, wording) are EXAMPLES ONLY.
All values must be fully editable via the admin panel.

1️⃣ Hero Image Credit (Top Story Image)

Add an optional text field in the Admin Story Editor:

Field label: Hero Image Credit

This field must be:

Fully editable per story

Stored in the story schema (optional)

On the frontend:

Display the hero image credit on the same line as the date

Same font family, size, and color as the date

Separated with a dot or divider

Example only (not hardcoded):

Dec 17, 2025 • Photo: CC Alex Abrams


If the credit field is empty → display only the date

2️⃣ Inline / Middle Image Credits (Inserted Images)

Extend the existing inline image syntax:

[IMAGE:url]


to optionally support:

[IMAGE:url|credit]


The credit portion must be:

Optional

Backward compatible (existing content must not break)

Admin Panel

When inserting or editing an inline image:

Provide an optional input field:

Image Credit

3️⃣ Frontend Display Rules (Very Important)

Inline image credit must:

Appear directly under the image

Be center-aligned

Use the same font, size, and color as the date

Be visually subtle

Have minimal vertical spacing

The credit should visually “hug” the image

Do NOT introduce a large margin or gap

Example only:

[IMAGE]
Photo: CC Alex Abrams

4️⃣ Text-to-Speech (Voice AI Reader)

Confirm that photo credits are NOT read aloud

Credits must be excluded using the same mechanism already used for:

Dates

Read time

Images

This applies to:

Hero image credits

Inline image credits

5️⃣ Styling & Safety Constraints

Reuse existing typography tokens

Do NOT introduce new fonts or sizes

All credit fields are optional

No existing stories should break

6️⃣ Final Checklist

Admin panel allows editing:

Story date

Hero image credit

Inline image credits

Frontend:

Hero credit appears beside date

Inline credit appears centered and tight under image

Voice reader skips all credits

Please implement cleanly using the current codebase patterns.
